If I am interpreting this correctly, this means that tracts with high median home values have a very low (close to 0%) proportion of Black residents, while tracts with low median home values have a much higher proportion (close to 63%). The bottom-right plot appears to indicate that there is also a relationship between proximity to Boston employment centers and median home value, with home values generally increasing as one gets further away from the employment centers.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 3\n**Are any of the predictors associated with per capita crime rate?

In addiion, tracts with higher proportion of lower status residents tend to have higher crime rates. I was also curious if there would be a relationship between crime rate and `B`, which serves as some kind of measurement for the proportion of Black residents. Based on the scatter plot between those two variables, there doesn't appear to be a clear relationship.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 4\n**Do any of the suburbs of Boston appear to have particularly high crime rates?

Both of these tracts have very high crime rates compared to the overall range for that variable, with values 38.3518 and 67.9208 putting them far into the upper quartile and into the range of being outliers. These tracts have no land zoned for residential lots of 25000 sq. ft., though this is in line with at least half of the tracts in the overall set given the median for `ZN` is 0. The two tracts do have a relatively high proportion of non-retail business acres, with values of 18.1 being right at the third quartile. Similarly, the tracts also have concentrations of nitric oxides in the upper quartile of the overall set with a value of 0.693 parts per ten million. The average number of rooms per dwelling for these two tracts is at the low end, with values of 5.453 and 5.683 putting them at the bottom quartile. Next, these two tracts are among those with the highest proportion of owner-occupied homes built prior to 1940, with a value of 100. The tracts are also quite close Boston employment centers with `DIS` values of 1.4896 and 1.4254 putting them at the bottom quartile. The tracts also are very close to radial highways with the maximum value of `RAD` at 24.

The tracts have relatively high values for `B`, though one tract has a maximum value while the other, with a value of 384.97, is in between the first and second quartiles. Lastly, the tracts have a high proportion of lower status residents (values of 30.59 and 22.98), putting them in the top quartile of the data.\n\nIn summary, these two tracts with the lowest median value of owner-occupied homes have predictors generally at the extreme ends of their respective ranges.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 8 \n**In this data set, how many of the suburbs average more than seven rooms per dwelling?
